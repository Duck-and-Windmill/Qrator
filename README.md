# OPERATION: GIT ROWDY (aka Qrator)

Qrator is an application that allows users to have a more nuanced control over how they rate their music. Instead of just rating songs from a scale of 1 to 5 or simply thumbing up or down songs, Qrator allows users to create custom fields by which to rate their music.
